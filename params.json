The role of cAMP activity in driving platinum-resistance was experimentally validated in vitro using a small molecule inhibitor of CREB1 phosphorylation that sensitized platinum- resistant primary HGSOC cells.  \r\n * Taken together, our findings strongly support InFlo as a robust systems biology approach for integrative analysis of multi-omics data to characterize complex biological signaling network activities in any given biological sample.\r\n\r\n<p>We expect InFlo to be widely applicable to reliably delineate key molecular determinants of disease progression, thus enabling the discovery of evidence-based biomarkers and therapeutic targets, as well as for facilitating selection of tailored therapies in individual patients.</p> \r\n____________________________________________________________________________________\r\n#### **Reference**\r\n____________________________________________________________________________________\r\n**Under Review**\r\n\r\n**InFlo: A Novel Systems Biology Framework Identifies cAMP-CREB1 Axis as a Key Modulator of Platinum Resistance in Ovarian Cancer** <br>\r\nNevenka Dimitrova(1), Anil Belur Nagaraj(3), Abolfazl Razi(3), Salendra Singh(3), Sitharthan Kamalakaran(1), Nilanjana Banerjee(1), Peronne Joseph(3), Alexander Mankovich(1), Prateek Mittal(2),#, Analisa DiFeo(3) Vinay Varadan(3)\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n##### __Support : Varadanlab@gmail.com__",
